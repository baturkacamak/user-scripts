# Wallapop Remove Featured Cards

The `AdsFilter` class is used to remove ads that have been bumped from the page on the Wallapop website. It provides a static method for initializing the filter and starting an interval that calls a method for removing the bumped ads.

# Installation

To install this userscript, you will need to do the following:

1. Install a userscript manager in your browser. There are several options available, such as Tampermonkey for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, or Greasemonkey for Firefox.
2. Once you have installed a userscript manager, click on the `wallapop-remove-featured-cards.user.js` file in this repository. This should open the userscript in your userscript manager.
3. Click on the "Install" button in the userscript manager to install the script.
4. The userscript should now be installed and active on the Wallapop website. You can verify this by going to the Wallapop website and checking if the ads that have been bumped are being removed from the page automatically.

Please note that this userscript will only work on the Wallapop website, and it will only remove ads that have been bumped from the page. It will not affect any other elements on the page.
