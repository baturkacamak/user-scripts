This userscript adds a button to download the currently highlighted image from Google Maps Places, attempting to fetch a higher resolution version.

## Key Features

-  Adds a download button directly on the Google Maps image viewer.
-  Automatically tries to get a higher resolution of the image (e.g., 1920px wide).
-  Saves images with a descriptive name based on the place and current date/time.
-  Integrates with the page's dynamic loading of images.

## How to Use

1.  Install the userscript (see install badge above).
2.  Navigate to Google Maps and open an image for a place.
3.  A download button (rotated back arrow icon) will appear, usually at the bottom of the image viewer.
4.  Click the image you want to make sure it is selected (the script tries to auto-select the first one on load).
5.  Click the download button to save the image.
