# Eksi Advanced Sorter

This script will sort topic messages by "favori" count, lenght and weight.

## Installation Guide

To install the Eksi Advanced Sorter userscript, follow these steps:

1. Install a userscript manager like [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/)
   or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/). These programs allow you to manage userscripts and run them on
   websites.

2. Click on the following link to install the
   script: [eksi-advanced-sorter.user.js](https://github.com/baturkacamak/user-scripts/raw/master/eksi-advanced-sorter/eksi-advanced-sorter.user.js)

3. Your userscript manager should open and display information about the script. Click on the "Install" button to
   install the script.

4. After the script is installed, visit a topic page on the [Eksisozluk](https://eksisozluk.com/) website. You should
   see two new buttons labeled "favori" and "length" at the top of the entry list.

5. Clicking on the "favori" button will sort the entries by their "favori" count in descending order, and clicking on
   the "length" button will sort the entries by their length in descending order. Clicking on the button again will
   reverse the sorting order.

That's it! You can now use the Eksi Advanced Sorter script to sort entries on the Eksisozluk website.
